# Macrocosmic Bargain: Revisting the Michael Jordan v Aliens Apocrypha

## Plot
Psychohistorian delves into the events depicted in _Space Jam_ from the point of view of the medical staff treating the NBA players whose talents are stolen by the Nerdlucks/Monstars, first-hand accounts of the attendees of the Minor League Baseball team Birmingham Barons game in which Michael Jordan  enters via cartoon spaceship, Jordan's estranged wife Juanita Vanoy, and Bill Murray.

## Medium
Hypermedia: interlinked vingettes that include graphics (e.g., basketball stat cards), data visualizations, generative visuals, audio. This would all give the illusion that the Psychohistorian has created an entire website in order to tackle this subject. This will also make allusions to the original (and still available) _Space Jam_ website by adapting its look and feel.
